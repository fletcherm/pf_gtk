This is an example of Presenter First in the context of GTK+ and C.

I've written a few articles describing this project. Read more about it here:
* [Presenter First in GTK and C](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2010/07/13/presenter-first-in-gtk-and-c)
* [Presenter First in GTK+ and C – Updated for 2012](http://spin.atomicobject.com/2012/07/27/presenter-first-in-gtk-and-c-updated-for-2012/)

Here are some resources and other links from the article:
